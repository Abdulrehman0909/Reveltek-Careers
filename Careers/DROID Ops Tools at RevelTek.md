# DROID Ops Tools

# Design
Design is a crucial aspect of the DROID Ops lifecycle, as it sets the foundation for the subsequent stages of Research, Optimize, Integrate, and Deliver. It involves defining the architecture and infrastructure of the system, selecting appropriate tools and technologies, and collaborating with different teams such as developers, operations staff, and QA engineers. The design process ensures that the system is reliable, scalable, and maintainable, while also meeting the requirements and constraints of the project. Overall, design is critical to the success of Tech Development projects.
 #### Figma
This is a great tool for collaborative design work. It allows multiple users to work on the same design project simultaneously, which can save time and increase productivity. Figma also has a wide range of design features that can help you create beautiful and functional designs. We mostly use it for UI/UX design and prototyping. Some of the features we use include:
- Components and instances
- Auto Layout
- Plugins (e.g., Content Reel, Design Lint, etc.)
- Commenting and feedback
 #### Jira 
Jira is a project management tool that can be used to manage design projects. It allows you to create and track tasks, assign them to team members, and monitor progress. Jira also integrates with other tools like Figma, which can help streamline your design process. We use it for project management and issue tracking. Some of the features we use include:
- Scrum boards and Kanban boards
- Custom workflows
- Task management and progress tracking
- Reports and dashboards
 #### VS Code
