# DROID Ops Tools

# Design
Design is a crucial aspect of the DROID Ops lifecycle, as it sets the foundation for the subsequent stages of Research, Optimize, Integrate, and Deliver. It involves defining the architecture and infrastructure of the system, selecting appropriate tools and technologies, and collaborating with different teams such as developers, operations staff, and QA engineers. The design process ensures that the system is reliable, scalable, and maintainable, while also meeting the requirements and constraints of the project. Overall, design is critical to the success of Tech Development projects.
