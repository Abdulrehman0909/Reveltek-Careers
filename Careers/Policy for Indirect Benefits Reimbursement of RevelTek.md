# Policy for Indirect Benefits Reimbursement of RevelTek

This policy outlines the procedure for reimbursement of indirect benefits. Indirect benefits are those that are not directly related to the employee’s job, such as travel expenses, entertainment expenses, NCB, or other miscellaneous expenses. These benefits will be paid directly to the account and not to the employee directly.

## 1. Eligibility - 
All employees are eligible for reimbursement of indirect benefits if they land/have a client on behalf of RevelTek. The employee must be an active employee at the time of the expense and must have prior approval from their supervisor or manager for the indirect benefits offered to him/her.

## 2. Documentation - 
All expenses must be documented and submitted with the reimbursement request. Documentation must include:
* The date of the expense;
* A description of the expense;
* The amount of the expense;
* Proof of payment (e.g. receipts, invoices, etc.); and
* Any other required documentation

## 3. Reimbursement Process & Procedure- 
Employees must submit a reimbursement request to their supervisor or manager for approval. The request must include all required documentation and must be submitted within 30 days of the expense. The supervisor or manager will review the request and approve or deny the reimbursement. If approved, the employee will be reimbursed within 30 days of approval.

* The employee must submit all bills and account information to their supervisor immediately upon receiving them.
* RevelTek will not be responsible for the late bill payment if the bills are not shared on the date bill is issued to the employee. 
* Therefore, the employee or the NCB needs to take care of sharing the bill and required details on time. 
* The supervisor will review the bills and account information and submit them to the appropriate department for processing.
* The department will review the bills and account information and approve or deny the request for reimbursement.
* If approved, the department will issue payment directly to the account.
* The employee must keep all receipts for a minimum of three years.

## Note: 
Reimbursement requests must be submitted within 30 days of the date of the expense. 

## 4. Appeals- 
If an employee's reimbursement request is denied, the employee may appeal the decision by submitting a written request to their supervisor or manager. The supervisor or manager will review the request and make a final decision. 

## 5. Tax Implications - 
Employees should be aware that any reimbursements received may be subject to taxation. The company is not responsible for any taxes incurred by the employee as a result of the reimbursement.
