# Reveltek Python Developer Take-Home Test
Welcome to the Reveltek Python Developer Take-Home Test! In this test, you will be demonstrating your ability in Python Development and your knowledge of Open Source Coding using Github.

### About the Calculator App

The calculator app is a simple application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using Python and a GUI framework called tkinter. The calculator app has two main branches, "functions" and "gui."
The "functions" branch contains the atomic model folder structure of the Python app and a calculator function. The "gui" branch contains the tkinter 2-page GUI implementation of the calculator app. Finally, the "master" branch combines the "functions" and "gui" branches.
To use the calculator app, simply enter two numbers and select the desired operation from the buttons provided. The calculator will then display the result of the calculation.

### What we are Looking For
- Clean and Minimal Code
- Timestamps that show you can complete this quickly and efficiently
- Great Atomic Model Folder Structure
- Clear Usage of Multiple Branches
- Frequent Commits. Each major change should have its own Commit that includes comments.
- Know how to build strong algorithms
- Know how to actually start, build, and deliver code.
- When making commits, only use Smart Commits.
- Do proper commenting, formatting, and proper English in all commits.
- Use labels, tags, and other Issue management to the best of your ability.
- Attach all development directly to an issue before you start working on it.
- Comment in your issues daily as if you are working on a large team, to let your "teammates" know what you've accomplished for the day like an Agile Daily Standup

## Instructions
Here are the instructions for the test:
1. Create a public repo titled "EasyCalc"
3. Create a readme file for the repo and tell us about your calculator app.
5. Create a milestone that is titled "Simple Calculator."
6. Create these 8 issues in this milestone:
   1. Mermaid Diagram
      - Create a mermaid.js diagram of how the app works
   2. Make a branch called "functions"
      - Inside this branch, create an atomic model folder structure of a python app.
      - Inside the app branch, make a calculator function of any kind.
   3. Create another branch called "gui"
      - Inside this branch, add a tkinter 2-page app.
   4. Create a 3rd branch called "master"
      - Inside master, combine the other 2 branches.
   5. Get the calculator to show up on gui and function properly.
   6. Turn this into a deliverable .exe file using pyinstaller.
   7. Add a feature enhancement to the calculator.
   8. Add any feature you want and follow the Smart Commit process.
   9. Make a 2nd .exe for v0.2 and update the readme of the changes you made of the comparable difference of v0.1 to v0.2.
